                        <h2>Top 10 Joker Quotes from The Dark Knight</h2>
                    </header>
                        <p>Alright, so since I have this obsession with The Dark Knight Trilogy, I figured that I would do
                            something in regards to that. I have decided to do the top quotes from The Joker (Heath 
                            Ledger) since he was my favourite character (besides James Gordan (Gary Oldman), 
                            Ra's al Ghul (Liam Neeson) and Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway). No one will ever be able to do 
                            a better job at the Joker than Heath Ledger did and if they do, it'll have to be out-standing.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>Anyway onto the actual quotes!</p>

                        <p><b>Oh, you. You just couldn’t let me go, could you? This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object. You are truly incorruptible, aren’t you? Huh? You won’t kill me out of some misplaced sense of self-righteousness. And I won’t kill you because you’re just too much fun. I think you and I are destined to do this forever.
                            </b>
                        </p>
                        <p><em>The reason why I love this quote is because I *love*</em>&nbsp;<em>philosophy and this was one of the themes that they had in the book. Batman has this one rule where he won't kill people and the book goes into explaining Batman's reasoning for everything and also what role the Joker played as well. It's a really interesting quote that was used in the movie.</em>

                        <p><strong>Do you want to know why I use a knife? Guns are too quick. You can’t savor all the… little emotions. In… you see, in their last moments, people show you who they really are. So in a way, I know your friends better than you ever did. Would you like to know which of them were cowards?</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p><em>This quote just was so intense. The way that the Joker said this was just perfect, in my eyes. It makes him seem a little more crazier after he says this.</em>
                        </p>
                        <p>***</p>
                        <p><strong>The only sensible way to live in this world is without rules and tonight, you're going to break your one rule.</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p><em>This part of the movie was just intense. He was going on about how society is and how they will "cast" Batman out when they no longer need him (which turns out the Joker was right, yes?) It was just another intense part of the movie.</em>

                        </p>
                        <p><em>I like this quote because it really is true. If you do upset the established order, things do become chaos because people won't know what to do with themselves. They've followed other people's orders for so long, that once they actually gain the freedom to do something on their own, they want to run right back to taking orders again.</em>

                        </p>
                        <p><em>This quote I thought was interesting. This is another aspect that makes him more "crazy" because he doesn't have a plan. You will never know what he is going to do next. He just goes with the flow and with whatever he feels like doing.</em>\

                        <p><em>This line is the first one that Joker ever makes the movie. It sets the tone for his character for the rest of the movie and is a very important one. I just love it because it also touches the philosopher in me too when he took a twist on&nbsp;Neitzsche's quote, "What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger". It was just brilliant!</em>

                        <p><em>I liked like quote a lot just because it was deep - at least it was for me. Everything burns, and when Alfred said his piece about "some men just want to watch the world burn" and have no real purpose in doing what their doing but that, it just proves Alfred's point in a sense when the Joker says this.&nbsp;</em>

You see, their morals, their code, it's a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them to be. I'll show you. When the chips are down, these... these civilized people, they'll eat each other. See, I'm not a monster. I'm just ahead of the curve.&nbsp;</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p><em>This is honestly one of my absolute favourite quotes of Joker's. It appeals to my dystopian side of me in some small sense about society and the way it is.&nbsp;Deep down, I agreed with him in the sense that he is ahead of the curve. He knows things about society that the ignorant, unquestioning people of the city don't. He just took it in a more destructive way than I had liked.</em>\

                        <p><em>This is pretty self-explanatory. The way he says it is just creepy and evil. It just makes him who he is. The stories he tells about himself are never the same and the way he tells them are just eerie and that's what makes this quote so great.</em>

                        <p><em>Everyone sees this coming, but you all know you'd put it in your list as well. This is what defines the Joker and his character. Again, the way that he says this is just so eerie and it is just one of the best lines he has in the movie.</em>
